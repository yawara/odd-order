# Inflation of irreducible characters

For a surjective group homomorphism `f : H →* G`, precomposition of class functions
(`ClassFunction.compHom f`) carries irreducible characters of `G` to irreducible characters
of `H`, and preserves degrees.  Specialized to the quotient map `f = QuotientGroup.mk' N`
for a normal subgroup `N ⊴ G`, this is the classical **inflation** correspondence
([Isaacs] (2.22)): an irreducible character `χbar` of `G ⧸ N` inflates to the irreducible
character `χbar ∘ (mk' N)` of `G`, whose kernel contains `N`.

The representation-theoretic core is that for a surjective `f`, the lattice of
subrepresentations of `σ.comp f` coincides (identically on the underlying submodule) with that
of `σ`: a submodule invariant under all `σ (f h)` is invariant under all `σ g` because `f` is
onto.  Transporting `IsSimpleOrder` along the resulting order isomorphism gives irreducibility
preservation.  Trace (hence degree) is preserved because `σ.comp f` and `σ` act by the *same*
linear maps on the same space (`(σ.comp f) h = σ (f h)`).

This is the first brick of the Inflation infrastructure gating Peterfalvi (6.6) G2.5
(the degree-sum identity over the characters with `Z ⊆ ker`): the inflation map embeds
`Irr(G ⧸ N)` into `{χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}` degree-preservingly, which feeds the
`Σ χ(1)²` bookkeeping via the Burnside identity `sumIrreducibleDegreeSq`.

## Main definitions / results

* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.Subrepresentation.compHomEquiv` — for surjective `f : H →* G`,
  the order isomorphism `Subrepresentation (σ.comp f) ≃o Subrepresentation σ`.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.Representation.isIrreducible_comp_of_surjective` — irreducibility
  of `σ` transfers to `σ.comp f` for surjective `f`.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.IsIrreducibleCharacter.compHom_of_surjective` — for surjective
  `f`, `ClassFunction.compHom f χ` is an irreducible character of `H` whenever `χ` is one of `G`.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.inflate` — the inflation map
  `IrreducibleCharacter (G ⧸ N) → IrreducibleCharacter G`, `χbar ↦ χbar ∘ (mk' N)`.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.inflate_apply_one` — degree preservation.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.inflate_injective` — injectivity of the inflation map.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.subset_characterKernel_inflate` — `N ⊆ ker (inflate N χbar)`.
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.exists_inflate_eq_of_subset_characterKernel` — surjectivity of
  `inflate` onto `{χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}` (the reverse inclusion, via the diagonalization
  keystone descending `ρ` through `Representation.ofQuotient`).
* `OddOrder.RepresentationTheory.sumInflatedDegreeSq` — the Peterfalvi (6.6) degree-sum identity
  `Σ_{N ⊆ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G ⧸ N|`, obtained by transporting Burnside on `G ⧸ N` across the
  inflation bijection.

Together these realize `inflate` as a **degree-preserving bijection**
`Irr(G ⧸ N) ≃ {χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}`.  The surjectivity onto the kernel-subset set rests on
descending the witnessing representation through `Representation.ofQuotient`, which needs `ρ` to act
trivially on `N`; that step uses the diagonalization fact `χ_ρ(n) = χ_ρ(1) ⟹ ρ n = id`
(finite-order operators over `ℂ` are semisimple, `rep_eq_id_of_character_eq_one`).  The bijection
delivers the degree-sum corollary `Σ_{N ⊆ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G ⧸ N|` (`sumInflatedDegreeSq`) from
Burnside's `Σ_{Irr (G ⧸ N)} χbar(1)² = |G ⧸ N|`.

surjective, so precomposition by it is injective on class functions
(`ClassFunction.compHom_injective_of_surjective`), and `inflate` is that precomposition packaged
on irreducible characters.

Together with `inflate_apply_one` (degree preservation) and `subset_characterKernel_inflate`
(image lands in `{χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}`), this realizes the inflation map as a
degree-preserving injection `Irr(G ⧸ N) ↪ {χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}`.  Surjectivity of this
injection (every irreducible character of `G` with `N ⊆ ker` arises by inflation) is the

/-- **Inflation is surjective onto the kernel-containing irreducible characters** ([Isaacs] (2.22),
the reverse inclusion).  Every irreducible character `χ` of `G` whose character kernel contains the
normal subgroup `N` arises by inflation: there is an irreducible character `χbar` of `G ⧸ N` with
`inflate N χbar = χ`.

This is the half of the inflation bijection that the **diagonalization keystone**
(`rep_eq_id_of_character_eq_one`) unlocks.  Take a witnessing irreducible representation `ρ` of `G`
with `χ = χ_ρ`.  For `n ∈ N`, `N ⊆ ker χ` gives `χ_ρ(n) = χ_ρ(1)`, so the keystone forces
`ρ n = id`; i.e. `ρ` is trivial on `N`.  Hence `ρ` descends through the quotient
(`Representation.ofQuotient`) to a representation `σ` of `G ⧸ N` with `σ.comp (mk' N) = ρ`, which is
irreducible because `ρ` is (`isIrreducible_of_isIrreducible_comp_of_surjective`).  Then
`χbar := χ_σ` is an irreducible character of `G ⧸ N`, and `inflate N χbar = χ_σ ∘ mk' = χ_ρ = χ`.

Together with `inflate_injective`, `inflate_apply_one` (degree preservation) and
`subset_characterKernel_inflate`, this realizes the inflation map as a degree-preserving
*bijection* `Irr(G ⧸ N) ≃ {χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}`, hence the (6.6) degree-sum identity

trivial on a normal subgroup `N ⊴ G` (`N ⊆ ker ψ` as character kernel) whose quotient `G ⧸ N` is

`ψ` descends through the quotient (`exists_inflate_eq_of_subset_characterKernel`) to an irreducible

(`IsIrreducibleCharacter.apply_one_eq_one_of_isMulCommutative`); inflation preserves degree

This is Peterfalvi (9.9.a)'s "`(θλ)(1) = 1`": the `HC`-character `ψ` lying under `χ ∈ 𝒳(H₀C')` is
linear because `[HC,HC]` lies in its kernel (`[H,H] ⊆ H₀`, `[H,C] ⊆ H₀` as `C = C_U(H̄)`, and

/-- **Peterfalvi (6.6) degree-sum identity** ([Isaacs] (2.22) corollary).  The sum of the squared
degrees over exactly the irreducible characters of `G` whose kernel contains the normal subgroup
`N` equals the order of the quotient `G ⧸ N`:
`∑_{χ ∈ Irr G, N ⊆ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G ⧸ N|` in `ℂ`.

This is the payoff of the **diagonalization keystone**: the keystone makes
`exists_inflate_eq_of_subset_characterKernel` (the surjectivity of inflation onto the
kernel-containing characters) available, so together with `inflate_injective`,
`subset_characterKernel_inflate` (image lands in the kernel-subset set) and `inflate_apply_one`
(degree preservation) the inflation map is a degree-preserving **bijection**
`Irr(G ⧸ N) ≃ {χ ∈ Irr G | N ⊆ ker χ}`.  Transporting the Burnside identity
`sumIrreducibleDegreeSq` for `G ⧸ N` (`∑_{χbar ∈ Irr (G ⧸ N)} χbar(1)² = |G ⧸ N|`) across this
bijection — via `Finset.sum_bij'` with `inflate N` as the forward map and the inflation-surjectivity
witness as its inverse — yields the displayed identity.

This is the form Peterfalvi (6.6) reads off the inflation correspondence: the irreducible
characters of `G` killing `N` are precisely the inflations of those of `G ⧸ N`, and their squared
degrees sum to `|G ⧸ N|` by Burnside on the quotient. -/

`∑_{χ ∈ Irr G, N ⊄ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G| − |G ⧸ N|` in `ℂ`.

The complement of `sumInflatedDegreeSq` inside the Burnside total `sumIrreducibleDegreeSq`
(`∑_{χ ∈ Irr G} χ(1)² = |G|`): the filter on `N ⊆ ker χ` and its negation partition `Irr G`
(`Finset.sum_filter_add_sum_filter_not`), so the `N ⊄ ker χ` sum is `|G|` minus the `N ⊆ ker χ`
sum `|G ⧸ N|`.

This is the (6.6)/(6.8) set `X = S − S(Z) = {χ ∈ Irr L | Z ⊄ ker χ}` degree-sum: with `N = Z`,

/-- **Peterfalvi (6.8.1) regular-character decomposition, off-identity value.**  For `z ∈ N^#`
(`z ∈ N`, `z ≠ 1`), the `N ⊄ ker χ` part of the regular character of `G` evaluated at `z` is
`-|G ⧸ N|`:
`∑_{χ ∈ Irr G, N ⊄ ker χ} χ(1)·χ(z) = -|G ⧸ N|` in `ℂ`.

This is the off-identity companion of `sumNonInflatedDegreeSq` (the `z = 1` value
`∑_{N ⊄ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G| − |G ⧸ N|`): the class function `ψ_N := ∑_{N ⊄ ker χ} χ(1)·χ`
(`= ρ_G − ρ_{G ⧸ N}`, the difference of regular characters) is constant on `N^#` with value
`-|G ⧸ N|`, so `ψ_N(z) − ψ_N(1) = -|G|` for `z ∈ N^#`.

Two ingredients: the **full** regular character vanishes off `1`
(`∑_{χ ∈ Irr G} χ(1)·χ(z) = 0`, second/column orthogonality `column_orthogonality_not_conjugate`
at the non-conjugate pair `z ≁ 1`); and the **`N ⊆ ker χ`** part is the regular character of
`G ⧸ N` at `mk z = 1`: each such `χ` is constant on `N`, so `χ(z) = χ(1)`, whence
`∑_{N ⊆ ker χ} χ(1)·χ(z) = ∑_{N ⊆ ker χ} χ(1)² = |G ⧸ N|` (`sumInflatedDegreeSq`).  Subtracting,
the `N ⊄ ker χ` part is `0 − |G ⧸ N|`.

With `G = L`, `N = Z`, this is the mmd 04.8 L168 identity
`∑ d_iχ_i(z) = (1/(a|W₁|))(ρ_L − ρ_{L/Z})(z) = -|L:Z|/(a|W₁|)`, the step showing `η₁^{τ₁}` is

/-- **Inflation preserves (ir)reducibility, both directions.**  For `N ⊴ G` and any class function
`ψ` of `G ⧸ N`, the pullback `compHom (mk' N) ψ` is an irreducible character of `G` iff `ψ` is an
irreducible character of `G ⧸ N`.

Forward is `IsIrreducibleCharacter.compHom_of_surjective` (`mk' N` is surjective).  Backward: an
irreducible `compHom (mk' N) ψ` has `N ⊆ ker` (it is constant `= ψ 1` on `N`), so by
`exists_inflate_eq_of_subset_characterKernel` it equals `inflate χ̄` for some irreducible `χ̄`;
since
`compHom (mk' N)` is injective (`compHom_injective_of_surjective`), `ψ = χ̄` is irreducible.

This is the reducibility correspondence of the §9↔§6 bridge: via the induction-inflation commute
`induceHU (inflate χ̄) = compHom (mk' N) (induce K̄ χ̄)`, the §9 member `φ = induceHU (inflate χ̄)`
is
reducible iff the §6 induction `induce K̄ χ̄` is (issue 1012, B2 bijection). -/

/-- **Inflation along an arbitrary surjective homomorphism.**  If `f : H →* G` is surjective and
`χ` is an irreducible character of `H` whose character kernel contains `ker f`, then `χ` factors
through `f`: there is an irreducible character `χbar` of `G` with `χ = χbar ∘ f`
(`compHom f χbar = χ`).

This generalizes `exists_inflate_eq_of_subset_characterKernel` (the case `f = mk' N`) to any
surjective `f`, by factoring `f = (quotientKerEquivOfSurjective f) ∘ mk' (ker f)` and transporting
the `mk'`-inflation `θ̄₀ : Irr(H ⧸ ker f)` across the iso `H ⧸ ker f ≃* G`.  It is the form needed
