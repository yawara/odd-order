# Feit-Thompson Theorem

This is the top-level file for Phase 4 of the project: the odd-order theorem,
*every finite group of odd order is solvable*.

## Structure of the top-level reduction

The proof is organized into a *downstream* reduction (pure group theory, fully
formalized here) and a single *upstream* obligation (the entire local + character
analysis, still to be constructed):

* `feitThompson_of_noMinimalSimpleOdd` — the **minimal-counterexample reduction**.
  By strong induction on `|G|`, if there were a finite group of odd order that is
  not solvable, a counterexample of minimal order would be a *minimal simple group
  of odd order* (`BG.IsMinimalSimpleOdd`): every proper subgroup and every proper
  quotient is solvable (induction hypothesis), so the group is simple (an extension
  of a solvable group by a solvable group is solvable). This step is `sorry`-free.

* `sectionSixteenHypothesis_of_isMinimalSimpleOdd` — the **single remaining upstream
  obligation**. From a minimal simple group of odd order, the Bender–Glauberman
  local analysis (BG §7–§16) together with Peterfalvi's character theory
  (Peterfalvi §10–§16) constructs the Section 16 field-normalizer configuration.
  This is the one `sorry` that the whole remaining project targets.

* `noMinimalSimpleOdd_of_section16` / `noMinimalSimpleOdd` — the **already-wired
  final contradiction**: once the Section 16 configuration is available,
  `BG.AppC.final_contradiction` derives `False` (BG Appendix C contradicts the
  standing inequality `q < p` of Peterfalvi §16).

`feitThompson` then combines the reduction with the (currently `sorry`-blocked)
non-existence of a minimal simple group of odd order.

/-- **The one remaining upstream obligation.** From a minimal simple group of odd
order, the Bender–Glauberman local analysis (BG §7–§16) together with Peterfalvi's
character theory (Peterfalvi §10–§16) constructs the Section 16 field-normalizer
configuration of Peterfalvi (14.2).

Everything *downstream* of this point is already formalized:
`noMinimalSimpleOdd_of_section16` feeds the configuration into BG Appendix C, which
contradicts the standing inequality `q < p`. So this is the honest top-level
statement of "all of the local and character analysis remains to be done"; it is
the only `sorry` reachable from `feitThompson` other than the scaffold obligations
already inside BG Appendix C / Peterfalvi §16. -/

/-! ## The minimal-counterexample reduction -/

/-- **Minimal-counterexample reduction** (pure group theory, `sorry`-free).

If no minimal simple group of odd order exists, then every finite group of odd
order is solvable.

The proof is strong induction on `Nat.card G`. If `G` were a non-solvable group of
odd order, then — using the induction hypothesis on its (smaller, odd-order) proper
subgroups and proper quotients — every proper subgroup is solvable and `G` is
simple: a proper nontrivial normal subgroup `N` would make `G` an extension of the
solvable group `N` by the solvable group `G ⧸ N`, hence solvable
(`solvable_of_ker_le_range`). Thus `G` would be a minimal simple group of odd
order, contradicting the hypothesis `hno`. -/

This combines the `sorry`-free minimal-counterexample reduction

single upstream obligation `sectionSixteenHypothesis_of_isMinimalSimpleOdd`. -/
